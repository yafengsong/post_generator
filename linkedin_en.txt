Example 1:

Example 2:
Obtaining a consensus on preoperative liver function tests before undergoing liver surgery is essential to ensure patient safety, guide surgical planning, optimize anesthetic management, predict outcomes, and enable informed decision-making. 

It contributes to a comprehensive and coordinated approach to liver surgery that leads to better patient outcomes and reduced risks of complications.

Grateful for participation in the newly published guidelines - a joined European effort among specialists within the field

First operation at the Mänedorf Hospital.

Andreas Rickenbacher and René Vonlanthenhave successfully performed this operation with a robot-assisted sigmoid colon resection.

The patient recovered quickly thanks to the qualified care and was sent home. The start at the Mänedorf site has been successful and we are very much looking forward to further cooperation!

Example 6:
Over a year ago, we introduced a centralised transport service at the Hirslanden Clinic. This was intended to bundle patient and goods transport, plan and handle it more efficiently and thus relieve our nursing staff.

The results after one year are impressive!

We would like to thank everyone who has contributed to this success, especially our hard-working transport team.

Haemorrhoids - what helps?

Around 70% of adults suffer from haemorrhoids. A disease that is often still a taboo and therefore many do not dare to see a doctor. Dr Jeanne Fürst asks the specialists Dr Andreas Müller from the Gastrozentrum Hirslanden Zurich and PD Dr Daniel Dindo from the Zurich Surgical Centre. 

Which conservative methods help and are any operations still so painful? 
At GESUNDHEITHEUTE you can also find out what you can do to treat haemorrhoidal disease yourself and whether you can get rid of this ailment forever?
